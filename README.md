# SUN SHINES BRIGHT : THINKING ABOUT AI AND DESIGN IN CLIMATE CRISES
## WORKSHOP FOR LA SEMAINE DE TOUS LES POSSIBLES, HEAD, Geneva
## Teacher: COMPUTATIONAL MAMA
### DESCRIPTION
As designers, we are often burdened with the responsibility of enacting change. But how can we move forward with ideas and action if we do not fully understand the technologies we work with? How can we bring back hope to our design processes?
This workshop invites participants to learn, understand, and address how artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) shape our work and practice as designers. Together, we will deepen our understanding of collective efforts, build resilience and hope, and focus our energies on building an inclusive future.

Over the course of the week, participants will explore:

- The infrastructures and impacts behind the AI we use every day

- Why AI and LLMs are important to future designers

- How conversational user experience (UX) will shape our design practices in the years to come

- How we can begin to create these infrastructures ourselves

- Why understanding technology — and its embedded criticalities — is a vital skill for designers today

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Create critical, feminist AI bots and interfaces (digital or physical)

- Build a mini data center inside the classroom

- Build prototypes of renewable energy systems

This workshop is open to all students who care about a collective future of design. No technical skills are required — just a willingness to learn new things, roll up one’s sleeves, and build something together. All parts of the workshop will be group activities.
